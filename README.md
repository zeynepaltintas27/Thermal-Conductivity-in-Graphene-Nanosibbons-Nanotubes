In this project, the thermal conductivities of graphene, nanoribbons, and nanotubes are analyzed. The **Ovito** folder contains files intended solely for visualization purposes. The **Reel** folder includes representations of the graphene lattice with a four-atom unit cell, which are not used in the calculations. The **Phonon** folder holds files related to computations for graphene with a single unit cell.
